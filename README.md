## Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher

This is a solution to the **Social media dashboard with theme switcher** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H).  
The challenge helped me practice building responsive layouts, managing dark/light theme toggling, and using modular front-end tools.
